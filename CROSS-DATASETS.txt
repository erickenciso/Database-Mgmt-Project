These queries should use a join to combine the data.
● Briefly describe what results the query is expected to produce and what SQL operations
the query will use to produce those results (1-2 sentences).
● Briefly describe what type(s) of data transforms are required to successfully implement
the query (1-2 sentences).


- We could join dataset1 and dataset2 to find a relationship between Yelp average ratings and the average of stock
open prices(5 years). The query is expected to produce an descending order of Yelp average ratings of the companies 
listed in S&P 500 and their according average open stock prices. The SQL operations the query will use are INNER JOIN, 
AVG, GROUP BY, and DESC. An element-wise transform is required on dataset1 to remove all the quotation marks used for 
business names. Another transform is required on dataset2 to add another column, or change, the stock's ticker name 
into business names.
