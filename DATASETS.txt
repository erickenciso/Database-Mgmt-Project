#describe the data
Our main dataset contains subsets of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. The dataset provides access
to information about business across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries. The dataset includes business
IDs, addresses, review counts, user IDs, star rankings, compliments, and more. The source of our files is 
kaggle and this dataset was put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge. In this dataset, there are a 
total of 5,200,000 user reviews and information on 174,000 businesses. The data file 'Business' consists 
of 13 fields and 174,567 rows, the data file 'Review' consists of 9 fields and 5,261,668 rows, and the data 
file 'User' consists of 22 fields and 1,326,100 rows.

#interesting attributes and relationships in the data
Interesting attributes: review_count, yelping_since, average_stars
Relationship: Reviews are written by users who have consumed services from the businesses. Also, there are
multiple attributes linking to each other so that we could see trends across the three files.

#insights we hope to gain from analyzing the data
- how influential users are depending on how long they have been 'yelping' for
- if the number of 'yelp friends' affects the number of fans
- which industries had the highest average ratings
- relationship between the average stars of users and types of compliments
